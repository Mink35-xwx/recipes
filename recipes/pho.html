    <h2><strong>What is Pho?</strong></h2>
    <p>Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.</p>
    <h2><strong>Pho Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p>Because you're making this authentic Vietnamese soup completely from scratch, the ingredient list is a little hefty. Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef Soup Bones:</strong> Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice Noodles:</strong> You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</li>
        <li><strong>Fish Sauce:</strong> Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>How to Make Pho</strong></h2>
    <p>Pho is quite simple to make, it's just a little time consuming. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below â€” but here's what you can expect when making this pho:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft.</li>
        <li>Make the broth.</li>
        <li>Soak the rice noodles for an hour. Meanwhile, bring the broth to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Boil the noodles, then drain and add them to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Top with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
